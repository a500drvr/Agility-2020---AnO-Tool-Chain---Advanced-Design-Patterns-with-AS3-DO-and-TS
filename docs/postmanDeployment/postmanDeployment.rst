Postman Deployment - Option 1
=============================

This direction of this guides the student down utilizing Postman as a REST client. Students interact at each step of the declarative process learning a clearer path to utilizing the tools and the benefits.

The ideal student progressing down this path has some programmability experience to BIG-IP; they have learned the Imperative REST and are seeking a better understanding of the bridge between Imperative and Declarative automation.

.. Note:: Reminder, no matter the path chosen in the lab, all students have the same result.
