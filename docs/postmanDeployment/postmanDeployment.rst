Postman Deployment
==================

This direction of the lab will guide the student down utilizing Postman as a REST client. Students will interact at each step of the declarative process learning a clearer path to utilizing the tools and the benefits.

The ideal student progressing down this path has some programmability experience to BIG-IP; they have learned the Imperative REST and are seeking a better understanding of the bridge between Imperative and Declarative automation.

.. Note:: No matter the path chosen in the lab, all students have the same result.
