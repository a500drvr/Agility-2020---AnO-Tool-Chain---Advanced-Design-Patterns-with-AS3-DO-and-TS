Ansible Tower Deployment
========================

This direction of the lab will guide the student down utilizing Ansible Tower as an orchestration engine. Students work a CI solution with Ansible tower, either launching a fully orchestrated build or stepping through the steps slowly for better understanding.

The ideal student progressing down this path has a deep understanding of the F5 Automation Toolchain, and they are seeking design patterns of placing the ATC in a CI/CD pipeline.

.. Note:: No matter the path chosen in the lab, all students have the same result.
